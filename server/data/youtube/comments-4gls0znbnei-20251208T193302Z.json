Time stands still in a loop in the upside down, like the drawing shows. And the kids are obviously the psychic energy he needs  to activate  the wormhole and allow the mindflayer into earth.",

The very children he’s imprisoning right now, just like he once trapped Will, are the ones who will rise against him alongside Eleven and Will once they’re freed. Their hidden strength was already hinted at when Will took down the Demogorgons. And knowing the Duffer Brothers, with their love for ’80s kid-power stories and Spielberg-style showdowns, this is exactly the kind of ending they’re building toward. IT is a huge influence on them, and just like Pennywise was defeated when the kids overcame their fear, Vecna will fall the same way.",
